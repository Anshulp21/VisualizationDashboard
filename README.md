Region: Choose from regions such as Northern America, Asia, Europe, etc.
Country: Specific countries for a more detailed view.
Topic: Filter based on various topics like energy, economy, etc.
Year: Explore insights from a specific time range.
Intensity, Likelihood, Relevance: Explore data based on impact levels.


Visualizations

Bar Chart: Displays filtered data based on Intensity and Likelihood by end year.
Pie Chart: Shows the distribution of Intensity across different years.
Dependencies
Plotly.js: For rendering the visual charts.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the dashboard.
MongoDB: For storing and querying the JSON data.
Python: Backend to serve the data and handle the API requests.
